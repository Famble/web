					This is an easily accessible bathroom.

					<a onClick="toggleFAQ('svar3')"><img src="../image/down_arrow.png" id="downarrow" ><h4>Why are rooms marked with letters? What do those letters mean?</h4></a>
				</div>
				
				<article class="skjul" id="svar3">
					<p>As You have noticed we have rooms with different letters in front of the room number. Those letters are short for the street name, because each classroom is placed in different building area, which has a neighboring street.
					</p>
					<p>The aim with such marking is to motivate You to get better oriented not only in the school area, but also geographically. Our building, P35, is surrounded by 4 streets:
					</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Holbergs gate (Holbergs street)</li>
						<li>Holbergs plass (Holbergs square)</li>
						<li>Edvard Storms gate (Edvard Storm street)</li>
						<li>Pilestredet (which means fast-narrow-street)</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>These streets are included in the rooms marking as two or three symbols or letters:
					</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>PI means Pilestredet</li>
						<li>PE means Edvard Storms gate, near Pilestredet</li>
						<li>PS means Edvards Storms gate, near Holbergs gate</li>
						<li>PH1 means Holbergs gate</li>
						<li>PH2 means Holbergs plass</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>The “P” means “Paviljong” and it means: pavilion – an area inside the building (PI for Pilestredet is the only exeption). 
					</p>
					
					<p>Let’s look on this closer in an example. You just made it to school and You are standing on the ground floor. If You are looking for example for a room PI-847, than You already know that it’s placed nearest Pilestredet. You are looking that way, toward the cantine. The numbers have also a hint. The first number tells You on which level* the room is placed. So number 8 means the eight level. We strongly recommend the elevator in that case. When You go out the elevator go right. The room is by the sitting area.
					</p>
					
					<p>* In Norwegian system, all the people from East-Europe and other parts with different level-systems must remember that, the ground floor here equals to the first floor.

				There are plenty of sitting areas all around the building. You can sue the sitting arean near the cantine, sitting areas on every floor near classrooms (on the right after You exit the elevator). There are also specially designed places, such as: Læringssenteret (on the 3rd floor) and Datatorget (on the 4th floor).
